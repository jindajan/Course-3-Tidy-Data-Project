# Course-3-Tidy-Data-Project
##Repo Overview This project contains R script file (course3week4.R) that implements methods from Getting and Cleaning Data Course in order to make tidy data from raw data. The final data can be used for future analysis as it has labels and full description in the CodeBook file. CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data. The output file of the sctipt is called tidy_analysis.txt, and uploaded in the course project's data folder.

##Working with R script You will need to make one modification to R script before you can start work with it. In the setwd("D:\\PTF\\Data science toolbox") line of course3week4.R script you should set your working directory.

##Data Description You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
