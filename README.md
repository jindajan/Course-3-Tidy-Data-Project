# Course-3-Tidy-Data-Project
##Repo Overview This project contains R script file (course3week4.R) that implements methods from Getting and Cleaning Data Course in order to make tidy data from raw data. The final data can be used for future analysis as it has labels and full description in the CodeBook file. CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data. The output file of the sctipt is called avg_by_act_sub.txt, and uploaded in the course project's data folder.
